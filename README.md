# Consulting-Project-ECMO
Here, the data consists of 28 variables and a total of 129 observations (N=129).There are five binary outcome variables (ECMO48, ECMO, SurvECMO, SurvSt2, TFHS) and one continuous outcome (DTE). We apply Multiple Logistic Regression to model the significance of the predictors on different outcomes since our outcomes are binary.
